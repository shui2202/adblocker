# An adblocker Chrome extension I made

I believe it does a pretty good job, but on some websites such as YouTube, it doesn't wor, and I am currently trying to find a way around their anti-adblocking methods.

By the way, the Chrome extension icon is some random image I found when I searched up "adblock icons".
